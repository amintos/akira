LocalObjectDatabase
===================

A LocalObjectDatabase is a id-to-object storage.
Objects can be stored under multiple references and such under multiple ids.

There are three kinds of references present. 
Although they may reference the same object, those three types are used according to the process
the reference object is in and how it got there.
