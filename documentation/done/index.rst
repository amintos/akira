- Object references 
  `rst
  <reference.rst>`__
  `html

What is interesting
-------------------

- What is a Process.
  `rst
  <process.rst>`__
  `html
  <process.html>`__
  `py
  <https://github.com/amintos/akira/blob/playground/process/Process.py>`__

- A database for objects and references
  `rst
  <LocalObjectDatabase.rst>`__
  `html
  <LocalObjectDatabase.html>`__
  `py
  <https://github.com/amintos/akira/blob/playground/process/LocalObjectDatabase.py>`__


- How a Connection gets to know about its endpoints. 
  `rst
  <set_connection_endpoints.rst>`__
  `html
  <set_connection_endpoints.html>`__
  `py
