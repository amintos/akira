 
What is to be done
==================

- connection types

  - SOCKS4/5 support for TCP/IP connections
  
  - email connections
  
  - twitter connections
  
  - like objects on facebook
  
- distributed testing/TestCases (many computers)

- udp-broadcasting to cluster 

- indirect connections via existing ones and other processes

- packet signing

- packet encryption

- reduce stderr output from other processes

- debugging of processes

- distributed objects (lists, locks)

- distributed objects failsafe

- use pyECC

- @serializable -> functions+classes bound to local modules

- @serializable -> magnetlinks?

- solve problem: when unpickled object could use same connection to communicate and block.

- if there is an error on the other side of the connection I want to be able to access it.

- send proxy objects
